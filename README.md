## R code for data analyses
### MiST (INSERT-CODE-TITLE-HERE.R)  
  MiST analysis for the YFV-human and YFV-mosquito interactomes

### Clustering and Enrichment (INSERT-CODE-TITLE-HERE.R)
  Clustering and enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology and interolog mapping

### Foldseek, FATCAT, and NEEDLE (INSERT-CODEE-TITLE-HERE.R)
  Scripts used to generate Foldseek, FATCAT, and NEEDLE data.
  
## Data for human-Aedes structural and sequence alignments
- 12 MAR 2025 - (Uploaded) YFV-Foldseekout-Forward.tar.gz and YFV-Foldseek-out-Reverse.tar.gz
  Full .tar.gz Foldseek outputs are provided for the forward (Human to Aedes aegypti) and reverse (Aedes aegypti to Human) searches.
  The search results were limited to e-value < 1e-10.
  Blank text files were generated because a Foldseek search occurred but no results met the e-value threshold.

- 25 MAR 2025 - (Uploaded) YFV-NEEDLE-out.tar.gz
  Full .tar.gz NEEDLE outputs for the Human and Aedes aegypti proteins.

- 23 JUN 2025 - (Uploaded) YFV-NEEDLE-out-1.tar.gz and YFV-NEEDLE-out-2.tar.gz
  Replaced and updated previous NEEDLE output archive from 25 MAR 2025. Archive size was too large and was split into two files.
