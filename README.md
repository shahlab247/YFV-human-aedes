## Data for yellow fever virus AP-MS and human-Aedes structural alignments
12 MAR 2025 - (Uploaded) YFV-Foldseekout-Forward.tar.gz and YFV-Foldseek-out-Reverse.tar.gz
  Full .tar.gz Foldseek outputs are provided for the forward (Human to Aedes aegypti) and reverse (Aedes aegypti to Human) searches.
  The search results were limited to e-value < 1e-10.
  Blank text files were generated because a Foldseek search occurred but no results met the e-value threshold.

25 MAR 2025 - (Uploaded) YFV-NEEDLE-out.tar.gz
  Full .tar.gz NEEDLE outputs for the Human and Aedes aegypti proteins.
